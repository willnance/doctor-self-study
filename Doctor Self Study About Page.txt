Description
This app is part of a study on spaced learning to measure whether residents with spaced exposure to exam 
materials over time perform better than residents who aren’t using the app (and presumably cram for exams).
 It gives the ability for doctors to enter multiple choice questions and specify a time for the questions 
to go out to the residents. The residents are given 3 minutes to respond to the question after they’ve
 viewed it and 24 hours after they are first notified of having the question, after which time the question
 is no longer available to them. This app is supposed to provide a means of downloading the statistics on
 residents’ performance to a spreadsheet for analytics. Notifications are sent out via email, although 
there are plans to make that feature integrated into an iOS application using Push notifications to alert
 users they have a question.
